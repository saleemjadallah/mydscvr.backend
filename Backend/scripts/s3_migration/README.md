# S3 Migration Scripts

These scripts were used to migrate event images from local storage to AWS S3.

## Migration Process (Completed July 17, 2025)

1. **direct_s3_migration.py** - Main migration script that:
   - Uploaded 5,579 images (9.9GB) to S3
   - Created S3 URLs in `images.s3_url` field
   - Preserved original file structure

2. **update_ai_generated_to_s3.py** - Updated database to use S3 URLs:
   - Replaced `images.ai_generated` with S3 URLs
   - Ensured frontend compatibility without code changes
   - Updated 2,533 events successfully

3. **update_events_s3_urls.py** - Initial attempt to update S3 URLs (alternative approach)

4. **verify_s3_working.py** - Verification script to test S3 URLs

5. **check_s3_status.py** - Status check script

## Results
